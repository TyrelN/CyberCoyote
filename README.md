# CyberCoyote
Project by Dalmarr Hussein and Tyrel Narciso

This is a project we did for MDST 320 at UBC-Okanagan that allows you to create mesh distortions on our little Coyote friend based on various inputs.

Controls:
Right Mouse Button: Reveal the Coyote
Middle Mouse Button: Invert the mesh
Enter: Expand the mesh
CRTL: Particle effects

This project was a great exploration in shader manipulation, and familiarizing ourselves with the Unity Environment.
